Apr 2025:
=========
  - improve geo db build process:
    - get shared_stops into the export process, rather than post loading on remote servers
    - put the current processing here in gtfsdb_ext rather than in geo
    - fix and run "current" data updates on stag/prod servers
    - ...
 - run TRANS .csv export weekly / nightly
 - tmux is still used for geo's docker junk ... move to what we're doing with OMT to run in background
 - generate CHANGELOG via poetry (how?)
 - add bbox to route and pattern tables


 QUESTIONS:
 ==========
   - why does mult.current_stops only have 29 rows, and stops has 119 rows?  current update not working (weekends)?
   - nessus-agent-mo chewing up a lot of CPU in places?  seems intermittent.
